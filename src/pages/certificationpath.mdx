If you struggle to get a cloud job despite cloud provider certifications, here is some sharing! 3 years back, I struggled to articulate a structured learning path during my cloud learning/getting into a cloud job. Those days it was only cloud learning to learn cloud provider's product/services features.

Cloud provider's certifications are heavily focused on their product/features, and be careful to proclaim yourself to be called an architect or SME Professional after achieving certification(s).

Cloud-certified titles differ from real-world life, BUT you can gain a real-world life up to 70 to 80% if you manage to structure your learning.

So in the real world, the activities generally occur below.
<br/><br/>

**Planning Phase**



* How do you start a discovery phase of workloads for cloud migration

* What are the challenges during a workload discovery phase

* What are the pre-requisite to building a landing zone in the cloud

* How to write a design document for a cloud landing zone

* What are the steps followed of on-prem workload to cloud resource mapping

* What are the preliminary questions being asked by the security team for a cloud migration 

* What are the best practices followed for Cloud Cost Control 

* What are the pre-requisites to ensure cloud chargebacks go back to the respective departments

<br/>
**Execution Phase**

\-----------------

* Buy a domain name from NameCheap 

* create emails in azure AD and if you can afford go for either P1 or P2 subscription for a few months 

* Build cloud providers SSO as the landing page 

* Integrate emails for login 

* All infra provisioning should be done with Terraform 

* Build a pipeline for code-build-deploy 

* Host a mini application on a rental on-prem data center 

* Do a POC from on-prem to Cloud using cloud provider VPN features 

* After cloud migration, make the application a cloud-native platform application 

* Measure the cloud costs post replatform

Do the cloud certification and the above activities, and then write about the POC in your resume/CV.

Your chances of getting a job are definite. All rational Hiring managers will appreciate the steps and efforts you have put together to gain real-world experience.

After all these learnings, if you still come across with interview questions like 'you type [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) then what happens, or you type [www.neflix.com](http://www.neflix.com/) then what happens, straight away walk out from the interview and tell the hiring manager that 'I will not be able to explain to you all that happens behind the scene because to make these works there are 1000's of people Google and Netflix have employed, and they have 1000's of servers working for the website to work!' :)

That's why I said, any rational hiring manager will appreciate your learning efforts! In the industry, there is a lack of rational hiring managers, unfortunately :)

**Navigating the rapidly evolving technology landscape can be challenging, but there are a few key strategies you can use to stay ahead of the game.**
 <br/>
1\. Start by identifying the specific technologies and tools you want to learn and understand how they fit into the broader ecosystem. In this case, you've identified Multi-Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), Terraform, Vault, and Snowflake as key technologies to focus on.

 <br/> 
2\. Research the different learning resources available, such as online tutorials, courses, and documentation. Look for resources that provide hands-on experience and practical applications of the technology.
 <br/> 

3\. Create a learning schedule and stick to it. Set specific goals and milestones for yourself, and hold yourself accountable for meeting them. Joining a community group like Cloud&DevOps Babies can be helpful in this regard, as it provides a supportive environment for learning and growth.
 <br/> 
4\. Build a practical project or POC to apply your learning. This can be a great way to demonstrate your skills to potential employers and showcase your ability to work with new technologies. The project you've proposed, building an application to track economic indicators and make stock market predictions, is a great example of a practical, real-world application of these technologies.
 <br/> 
5\. Keep an open mind, be humble, and be willing to accept criticism and learn from mistakes. It's important to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and the journey of learning is ongoing.
 <br/> 
Overall, staying ahead in the technology landscape requires a commitment to learning and continuous improvement, but with the right approach and mindset, it's definitely possible to master new tools and technologies and stay ahead of the curve.
